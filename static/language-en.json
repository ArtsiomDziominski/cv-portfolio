    "aboutTitle": "About myself",
    "aboutText": "I have always been fascinated by technology and enjoy to create something of my own. For example, back in school I developed servers for SAMP and programmed in the PAWN language, I was fond of Arduino. I self-taught the Python language, after that I got interested in front-end development and decided to build my career in this direction. Now every day I am developing my own projects and learning new frameworks. Easily adaptable and always result-oriented. My previous job in logistics has taught me how to work quickly and complete large projects on tight deadlines, as well as switch easily between different tasks and work effectively in a team."
